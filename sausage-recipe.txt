---------------------------------------------------------------------

Ingredients:

 -2lbs. of kielbasa, about 12 sausages
 -6 ounces beer (Belgium style ale, or dark beer)
 -2lbs. of fresh sauerkraut
 -1 teaspoon of fresh pepper (or more to your taste)

Directions:

 1. Saute kielbasa in a large frying pan or dutch oven until slightly browned
 (you can also grill the kielbasa for about 4 minutes on each side then add them 
 to pan and proceed with directions for even better flavor).

 2. Add beer, cover and simmer for about 30 minutes.  Remove lid and place kraut over
 kielbasa.  Sprinkle pepper over the kraut and just give the kraut a toss leaving it
 on top of the kielbasa.  Cover and simmer for about 15 minutes.  Remove lid and stir
 the kraut and kielbasa together well.  Cover and simmer for another 15 minutes.
